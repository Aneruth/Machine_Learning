Linear Regression Theory 

History : 
	
Started in 1800 by Francis Galton. He started by seeing the relationship between the children and their parents. He also investigated the fathers height with their sons. 

For classic linear regression or least square method we need to calculate the closeness in “up and down” direction. 

The goal of Linear regression is to minimise the distance between the data points and our line. 

Ways to minimise the data : 
	1. Sum of Squared Errors 
	2. Sum of Absolute Errors 

Popular method to minimise the data is “Least Square Method”. This linear regression line is fitted by minimising the sum of squares of the residuals. 
The residual of Observation is defined by the difference between the observation(the Y-value) and the fitted line.
